# Ravn_Code_Challenge
This repo has the required files for the code challenge with dublin related transportation data and the ETL to load the data from URL api to Snowflake using python
1) run the Snowflake query to create the stages for S3 buckets with your S3 credentials in the file called Snowflake Queries S3 Stages DDL and Selects
2) Put your credentials for S3 and snowflake in the python script named "RAVN_Coding_challenge_official.py" (you can get this information in the amazon web portal related cloud services and the snowflake web portal). See the PDF named "Tutorial - How to run this ETL" for more details
3) A cron job is configured for daily run, see the PDF named "Tutorial - How to run this ETL"
4) The design of the ETL is in a document called "ETL Design"
